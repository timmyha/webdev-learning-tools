### quality resources for beginner webdevs in 2022

#### javascript

- [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) & [javascript.info](https://javascript.info) - I flipped between these two to get different perspectives.
- for a cheaper bootcamp-like course, [scrimba](https://scrimba.com) is very good. some of the courses are free.
- CodeAcademy is another option.
- For higher-order functions in javascript (map, reduce, filter, etc), [fun fun function's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUiFMZr7vk&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84) youtube playlist is amazing.

- _bonus_ I did not use [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com), but I recently have been doing it to learn Ruby on Rails, and the Fundamentals chapter was actually very good. It teaches you git basics and how to use the command line, which is something I've seen people struggle with in study groups. I would consider beginning with that chapter if you aren't well-versed in how the internet works (such as HTTP requests, how domains work, etc)

#### react

Every bozo on the internet has a different opinion of when you should move onto a framework, and which one. The answer is React, and immediately. I'm very anti-opinions when it comes to what tools you should use, but thus far I haven't seen a way around learning React. It's important to understand vanilla JS, as you'll need to understand how frameworks compile down to it, but if you can build some basic vanilla js apps and understand higher-order functions, you are ready to roll on React. For a simple vanilla JS project, think something like [this](https://codepen.io/timhansher/pen/poWZbbK).

- the [free React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) on Scrimba was an absolute game changer for me.
- I would also recommend [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com), a boot-camp style online course from the University of Helsinki. This is a very difficult course that refuses to hold your hand. If you completed this I would have no doubt you would be hirable. I made it to part 3, then did the scrimba react course, and it was enough to dream up my own projects and go from there.

#### backend

I really don't think it matters what backend you choose, as it totally depends on the job and I have yet to interview for a position that wanted NodeJs, they just wanted me to know one of them. They all do the same thing.

###### nodejs

- [fullstackopen](https://fullstackopen.com) - part 3 gave me my foundation
- [this ben awad tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ypD7qv3Z8) is 12 hours of straight project building. any time I got stuck on how to do something I would just find the part where he does it in that video. I wouldn't recommend trying to follow it, but the initial setup portion of the video is something I usually go back to when beginning a new typescript node project.

###### ruby on rails

- i think Ruby on Rails is way easier to understand than Node, so if picking up Ruby is an option (super similar to Javascript, just with a different syntax. very easy to learn), I would do [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) and pick the Ruby pathway. Had I done this, I probably would have been able to build a full stack app faster, and understand any of the back ends should help you learn the next one. Not a bad option.

###### other options

- another option is learning [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/), which is Microsoft's super opinionated (read: easy because you don't have to make decisions) backend framework. For this you'd have to learn C#, but I built a quick API with it and was able to pick it up fairly easy. Depending where you want to work, this could be a great choice.
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) is a backend-as-a-service that is build on top of Postgres. If you'd like to work with Postgres but don't want to set up your own server, this is an awesome option. I use it for my personal projects. You can probably bypass learning backend altogether by using this, since you'll still be able to list SQL, using ORMs, and connecting your front end to authentication and a backend.

#### leetcode

- [data structures and algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0) - the GOAT video for learning general DSA info.
- [linked lists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj_rA0dhr2I) - super easy to understand and in JavaScript for bonus simplicity, I would probably watch this before attempting any sort of leetcode/hackerrank/codewars problem. I think it really got me in the correct mindset of solving problems, and the way recruiters generally want to see you think. Alvin 5evr

#### bootcamp-like

I'm going to list the free bootcamp-style routes you can go, but if you get stuck on one, try going to the same part (or backtrack a little!) of a different bootcamp to seek a different perspective. I found this the only way to keep my tears at bay.

- [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org), the html/css/javascript portions are great, I don't think it's as useful for frameworks/backend. Their youtube channel is unmatched.
- [TheOdinProject](https://theodinproject.com), if I were to start over, I would start with this. It's easy to follow along and gets right to the point. Learning things like command line and git are so crucial, and this is one of the few courses that begins with it.
- [fullstackopen](https://fullstackopen.org), switch the language to English unless you speak Suomi. This course is incredible, but if it reads like technical jargon translated from English to Finnish, that's because it is.
- [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com), definitely check out Scrimba, they have great courses (I think the react course is required viewing) but the Discord server has a help section that saved my life a few times.
